# Team Score: 1894 by Section 2, Fall 2024

We, section 2 of fall 2024, have just etched our names into the history of BallDropGame. In a thrilling display of skill, teamwork, and ingenuity, we shattered the all-time high score in our class gaming competition. But this wasn't just any ordinary gaming session â€“ we did it with controllers we built ourselves!
